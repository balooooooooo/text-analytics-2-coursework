The first time we had a long wait for food after ordering, this time we had an even longer wait of over 40 minutes. I had the omelette skillet and there was hardly any egg in it, I felt like I was eating chopped onions and chopped tomatoes. My wife had a BLT and had a hard time finding the tomato and the avocado that was supposed be on it.

We were seated right away and the server brought water, coffee and took our orders right away. We waited over 30 mins for breakfast. I got the freebird and came out first before my husband's dish. While it tastes good, it was just potatoes and the spicy sausage gravy was mostly a sauce. There was barely any sausage. My husband got the ny deli omelette that had way too much cheese that it overpowered everything and very little pastrami. Lastly, we were ready to go and our server spent at least 10 mins chatting at another table so I couldn't get our check. I'm not sure if we will return. - Loss: 2.4259049892425537\n",

Call ahead if you can so you don't have to wait.  It took us 10 minutes to have our server acknowledge us once we waited 35 minutes for a table.  It took another 10-15 to get coffee, and were never given cream. We were given a pitcher of water, but had to ask for glasses so we could drink it.  They are understaffed and we visited on a Saturday morning when they were having a special event, so they should have known better! Food was amazing and my fiancé loved his coffee!  We definitely got better service at the Warrington location, so if you're thinking about trying this place out I would say go to the Warrington one.  They also have a better waiting area and full counter service area to get coffee while you are waiting! - Loss: 2.265700340270996\n",

After waiting we'll over an hour for a table our waitress forgot our drinks and the food that came out was not what we ordered. The avocado toast was tasteless and not up to speed while the rest of the food was on par with a greasy spoon joint and not the modern fresh atmosphere suggested. I suggest we all give them time to find their legs, train their staff, and improve the quality of the potentially appealing menu. - Loss: 2.5250790119171143\n",

      "For one of the few brunch places that you can find in the suburbs, Turning Point is okay. The restaurant is quite crowded around 10-11 am on the weekend or holidays so I recommend making an reservation if you have a large party. They have so many options and are known for their pancakes. Their clean juices are pretty good but their food is alright. The dishes are decently sized but quite heavy so I'd recommend sharing one. Their pancakes are what you expected out of a standard pancake. Their omelets are quite bland so I don't recommend getting them. \n",

Everything is delicious, and its very economically priced. The service can be slow, it's hit-or-miss, but always very nice and courteous and with a smile. Its not very fancy, agree with another reviewer that its like eating in the middle of an Indian grocery store, and you will occasionally have people showing up to pick-up their catering orders, or worse their raw meat orders. But you don't really notice it as you eat your Nihari, or Chicken 65, or Tikka Masala, or kakob roll, or...well you get my drift.

But we have systematically ordered almost every dish on the extensive menu and have yet to really hate or even have a strong dislike of anything.

We also didn't get the salad that comes with the sandwich just the side of fries which we had ordered to share in addition to the salad.  That would have been fine but we were charged for a side of fries instead of it being the side for our sandwich.

What can I say about the manager that doesn't want to help her guest when they need food. I was a regular customer trying to get food for my short lunch. I always call ahead other places to ensure I can have food ready to eat when I get there. The woman manager said she couldn't do that. They couldn't prepare food unless I had take out. Which made no sense to me.  When I got there she stated she didn't want people to get use to doing that. Which means to me. She doesn't want people to get use to ordering food and enjoying there meal. She had the worst attitude and I told her that she had the worst customer service I've ever seen. Like I said before.

Sunday-Thursday, they have a killer deal at 1/2 off sushi rolls for a majority of their rolls. My favorite roll is the MEXICAN ROLL (cooked salmon on top, avocado, jalapeño, tempura, crab....). If you haven't tried it, it's a definite must with their delicious spicy mayo sauce! As for the teppanyaki, I'm addicted to the fried rice and shrimp and salmon that the best chef- Carlos makes!! Carlos is very fun to sake bomb with and also makes a delicious \"Malibu\" plate!

He used to come here with big groups of friends to launch a night of underage drinking up and down State St. and now he comes with big groups of hockey kids and their families when we pass through town on our way to hockey tournaments down south.  It's a great place for a big group -  even without a reservation.  The teppanyaki show is great for kids and the noise level of the place on our recent trip drowned out the noise our kids were making.  The teppanyaki is good here and we love the sushi (especially the Something's Fishy roll - spicy) even though you can get better sushi all over SB.  The room is well worn and the atmosphere is raucous on weekend nights and you may feel like you've crashed a frat party, but we love it. - Loss: 2.899193048477173\n",
