The fillings had watery texture instead of the creamy taste they should have. \\n\\nI also ordered \"honey citron tea\" which the sign said $1.25, then the lady charged me $1.50. I positively thought they must have changed the price. As I went back, she got my order wrong and gave me \"honey ginseng tea\" instead. Ugh.

The rice also comes pre-coated in spicy sauce, which I didn't mind but may be a problem for people who prefer their food totally mild or want to customize the spice level.

These stores definitely embrace the open and shared space concept. I came expecting a full on bakery, instead it is more like a cafe with lots of inside and outdoor seating. It is nice and cool inside on this hot summer day. Perfect for sipping on our mochas or lattes while enjoying a pastry. A tour group came in and they were served the galette, which looks amazing. I should have ordered that instead of the donut. Although the donut was tougher than I thought (resembles more like the texture of a bagel), I still enjoyed it nonetheless. - Loss: 2.9616363048553467\n",
